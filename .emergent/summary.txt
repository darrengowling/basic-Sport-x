The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a simple cricket auction app into a comprehensive Sport X fantasy cricket tournament platform and has begun forking it for Kabaddi. Initial work involved rebranding and extensive troubleshooting of deployment and connectivity issues, including invalid host header and failed to connect to server errors, which required meticulous adjustments to backend                          RUNNING   pid 27, uptime 0:00:06

Subsequently, the engineer implemented major features like a multi-step tournament creation process with detailed rules, real-life player selection, dynamic team management, and a robust points system. Iterative improvements such as removing fantasy branding and adding a Testing Guide page were also completed. The current effort is a Quick Kabaddi Fork, involving new data models, backend endpoints, and dedicated frontend components, demonstrating a systematic approach to extending the application's domain.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to rebrand the existing  repository as Sport X, preserving cricket functionality and AI features.

The application was then enhanced to become a comprehensive peer-to-peer cricket tournament platform, incorporating the following:
*   **Tournament Management**: Users can act as admins to create tournaments based on real-life cricket events (e.g., IPL), define rules (squad composition, budget, bid increments), set auction dates/times, and invite participants.
*   **Monetization**: Implement entry fees and associated prize pots, determined by user contributions (e.g., £5 entry fee per user).
*   **Live Auction**: Players are drawn randomly, and users bid within a time limit using a notional budget (e.g., £500M). The highest bidder wins the player, adding them to their squad.
*   **Performance Tracking & Scoring**: The app must continuously monitor real-life player performance (runs, wickets, catches, stumpings, run-outs, bonus points) and allocate points accordingly (e.g., 1 point per run, 25 points per wicket). User scores are updated in real-time.
*   **Community Features**: Include an integrated chat function for communication during auctions and tournaments, and maintain a real-time leaderboard.
*   **Team Management**: The Team Management page should display actual teams formed after auctions and track their progress.
*   **Refinement**: Remove all instances of the word fantasy from the application's UI and text.
*   **Documentation**: Create a Testing Guide page to inform users about current features, ongoing enhancements, and future plans.
*   **New Sport Adaptation**: Repurpose the platform for Kabaddi, specifically for the Kabaddi Pro League. This quick fork should adapt player databases, roles (Raider, Defender, All-rounder), squad rules, and the points system to Kabaddi-specific metrics.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Application**: React.js (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend)
-   **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io for live auctions, chat, and score updates.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (implied for data persistence).
-   **Process Management**: Supervisor for running frontend and backend services.
-   **Networking**: CORS handling, proxy configuration, environment variable management for URLs.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for UI development.
-   **Modular Design**: Use of React components, contexts, and backend models.

<code_architecture>


-   : Project documentation. Initially rebranded to Sport X, later updated to reflect Kabaddi fork potential.
-   : Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend. Updated with project name sportx-app and  setting to direct API calls.
-   : The main Node.js/Express backend application. Handles all API endpoints (players, auctions, tournaments, AI predictions) and Socket.io communication. Significant changes were made to integrate tournament management logic, handle Socket.io events, and add new API routes for tournament and eventually Kabaddi features.
-   : Environment variables for the frontend. Created to set  for Socket.io and to disable host checking with  in supervisor config.
-   : Environment variables for the backend.  was explicitly set to 8001 to align with the Kubernetes environment's expectations.
-   : Supervisor configuration file. Modified to correctly define and manage the  (Node.js) and  (React) processes, including specifying their working directories, commands, and environment variables like .
-   : The main React component and routing configuration. Updated to include new routes for , , , , and  pages.
-   : Navigation component. Modified to include links to Tournaments and Testing Guide in both desktop and mobile navigation.
-   : The application's landing page. Updated to feature Tournaments as the primary call-to-action and include a link to the new Testing Guide.
-   : Page to display user teams. Replaced the coming soon placeholder with actual logic to show team details and tournament progress.
-   : Form for creating new tournaments. Transformed into a multi-step form integrating  and allowing configuration of squad rules, budget, bid increments, and dates.
-   : Manages the Socket.io connection. Crucially updated to use the correct backend URL (from ), and improved with more robust connection options like polling-first and better reconnection logic to resolve connectivity issues.
-   : New backend model to define the structure and rules of a cricket tournament (e.g., name, entry fee, participants, selected players, bid increment).
-   : New backend model for tracking and calculating points based on real-life player performances in a tournament.
-   : New JSON file storing Kabaddi player data for the Kabaddi fork.
-   : New backend model specifically for Kabaddi tournament settings, mirroring  but adapted for Kabaddi rules.
-   : New backend model for Kabaddi-specific performance tracking and point calculation.
-   : New frontend page to serve as the main hub for Kabaddi tournaments.
-   : New frontend page for creating Kabaddi tournaments.
-   : Reusable React component allowing admins to select players for a tournament, used in .

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of creating a Quick Kabaddi Fork of the Sport X platform, as agreed with the user. This involves adapting the existing cricket auction and tournament features to the sport of Kabaddi, with a focus on preparing for the Kabaddi Pro League.

The work accomplished so far in this phase includes:
1.  **Data Creation**: A new data file, , has been created to store Kabaddi player information.
2.  **Backend Models**: Two new backend models,  and , have been created. These are analogous to their cricket counterparts (, ) but will house Kabaddi-specific tournament settings and performance tracking logic.
3.  **Backend Endpoints**: The main backend server file, , has been updated to include new API endpoints for Kabaddi-specific functionalities.
4.  **Frontend Pages**: New frontend pages have been initiated:
    *   : Intended as the central hub for Kabaddi tournaments.
    *   : Designed for creating new Kabaddi tournaments, including their specific rules and settings.

The most recent action was initiating the creation of  for the Kabaddi context, suggesting the current focus is on adapting the player selection mechanism for Kabaddi tournaments, similar to how it was implemented for cricket. This indicates that the core framework for the Kabaddi fork is being laid out across both backend and frontend components.
